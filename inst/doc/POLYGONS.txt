	POLYGONS IN SPATSTAT

Polygon geometry computations in 'spatstat'
(such as computing the intersection or union of two polygons)
currently depend on the package 'gpclib'. 

'gpclib' has a restricted licence which explicitly forbids commercial use.

Accordingly, in 'spatstat' (versions 1.17-1 and later) 
the code which depends on 'gpclib' can be either enabled or disabled.

By default, 'spatstat' does NOT use 'gpclib'.
In this mode, polygon geometry computations will be executed by
converting the polygons to binary pixel images (`masks'), so that 
the result of the intersection or union will be a binary pixel mask.

If you are covered by the gpclib licence, you can enable the use of gpclib
inside spatstat by typing

              spatstat.options(gpclib=TRUE)

To check whether 'gpclib' is currently enabled or disabled, type 

		spatstat.options("gpclib")
