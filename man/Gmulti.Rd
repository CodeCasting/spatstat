\details{
  The function \code{Gmulti}
  generalises \code{\link{Gest}} (for unmarked point
  patterns) and \code{\link{Gdot}} and \code{\link{Gcross}} (for
  multitype point patterns) to arbitrary marked point patterns.

  Suppose \eqn{X_I}{X[I]}, \eqn{X_J}{X[J]} are subsets, possibly
  overlapping, of a marked point process. This function computes an
  estimate of the cumulative
  distribution function \eqn{G_{IJ}(r)}{GIJ(r)} of the distance
  from a typical point of  \eqn{X_I}{X[I]} to the nearest distinct point of
  \eqn{X_J}{X[J]}. 

  The argument \code{X} must be a point pattern (object of class
  \code{"ppp"}) or any data that are acceptable to \code{\link{as.ppp}}.

  The arguments \code{I} and \code{J} specify two subsets of the
  point pattern. They may be logical vectors of length equal to
  \code{X$n}, or integer vectors with entries in the range 1 to
  \code{X$n}, etc.

  This algorithm estimates the distribution function \eqn{G_{IJ}(r)}{GIJ(r)} 
  from the point pattern \code{X}. It assumes that \code{X} can be treated
  as a realisation of a stationary (spatially homogeneous) 
  random spatial point process in the plane, observed through
  a bounded window.
  The window (which is specified in \code{X} as \code{X$window})
  may have arbitrary shape.
  Biases due to edge effects are
  treated in the same manner as in \code{\link{Gest}}.

  The argument \code{r} is the vector of values for the
  distance \eqn{r} at which \eqn{G_{IJ}(r)}{GIJ(r)} should be evaluated. 
  It is also used to determine the breakpoints
  (in the sense of \code{\link{hist}})
  for the computation of histograms of distances. The reduced-sample and
  Kaplan-Meier estimators are computed from histogram counts. 
  In the case of the Kaplan-Meier estimator this introduces a discretisation
  error which is controlled by the fineness of the breakpoints.

  First-time users would be strongly advised not to specify \code{r}.
  However, if it is specified, \code{r} must satisfy \code{r[1] = 0}, 
  and \code{max(r)} must be larger than the radius of the largest disc 
  contained in the window. Furthermore, the successive entries of \code{r}
  must be finely spaced.

  The algorithm also returns an estimate of the hazard rate function, 
  \eqn{\lambda(r)}{lambda(r)}, of \eqn{G_{IJ}(r)}{GIJ(r)}. 
  This estimate should be used with caution as \eqn{G_{IJ}(r)}{GIJ(r)}
  is not necessarily differentiable.

  The naive empirical distribution of distances from each point of
  the pattern \code{X} to the nearest other point of the pattern, 
  is a biased estimate of \eqn{G_{IJ}}{GIJ}.
  However this is also returned by the algorithm, as it is sometimes 
  useful in other contexts. Care should be taken not to use the uncorrected
  empirical \eqn{G_{IJ}}{GIJ} as if it were an unbiased estimator of
  \eqn{G_{IJ}}{GIJ}.

\section{Warnings}{
  The function \eqn{G_{IJ}}{GIJ} does not necessarily have a density. 

  The reduced sample estimator of \eqn{G_{IJ}}{GIJ} is pointwise approximately 
  unbiased, but need not be a valid distribution function; it may 
  not be a nondecreasing function of \eqn{r}. Its range is always 
  within \eqn{[0,1]}.

  The spatial Kaplan-Meier estimator of \eqn{G_{IJ}}{GIJ}
  is always nondecreasing
  but its maximum value may be less than \eqn{1}.
