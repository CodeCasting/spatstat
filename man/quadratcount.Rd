    \item{xbreaks}{
      Numeric vector giving the \eqn{x} coordinates of the
      boundaries of the quadrats. Incompatible with \code{nx}.

\value{
  A contingency table containing the number of points in each
  quadrat.

\details{
  Quadrat counting is an elementary technique for analysing spatial
  point patterns. See Diggle (2003).
  
  The window containing the point pattern \code{X} is divided into
  an \code{nx * ny} grid of rectangular tiles or `quadrats'.
  The number of points of \code{X} falling in each quadrat is
  counted. These numbers are returned as a contingency table.

  If \code{xbreaks} is given, it should be a numeric vector
  giving the \eqn{x} coordinates of the quadrat boundaries.
  If it is not given, it defaults to a
  sequence of \code{nx+1} values equally spaced
  over the range of \eqn{x} coordinates in the window \code{X$window}.

  Similarly if \code{ybreaks} is given, it should be a numeric
  vector giving the \eqn{y} coordinates of the quadrat boundaries.
  It defaults to a vector of \code{ny+1} values
  equally spaced over the range of \eqn{y} coordinates in the window.
  The lengths of \code{xbreaks} and \code{ybreaks} may be different.

  The algorithm counts the number of points of \code{X}
  falling in each quadrat, and returns these counts as a
  contingency table. The \code{[i,j]} entry in the contingency table
  is the point count for the quadrat with coordinates
  \code{(xbreaks[i],xbreaks[i+1])} by \code{(ybreaks[i], ybreaks[i+1])}.

  To perform a chi-squared test based on the quadrat counts,
  use \code{\link{quadrat.test}}.
