\details{
  The \eqn{K} function (variously called ``Ripley's K-function''
  and the ``reduced second moment function'')
  of a stationary point process \eqn{X} is defined so that
  \eqn{\lambda K(r)}{lambda K(r)} equals the expected number of
  additional random points within a distance \eqn{r} of a
  typical random point of \eqn{X}. Here \eqn{\lambda}{lambda}
  is the intensity of the process,
  i.e. the expected number of points of \eqn{X} per unit area.
  The \eqn{K} function is determined by the 
  second order moment properties of \eqn{X}.
 
  An estimate of \eqn{K} derived from a spatial point pattern dataset
  can be used in exploratory data analysis and formal inference
  about the pattern (Cressie, 1991; Diggle, 1983; Ripley, 1988).
  In exploratory analyses, the estimate of \eqn{K} is a useful statistic 
  summarising aspects of inter-point ``dependence'' and ``clustering''.
  For inferential purposes, the estimate of \eqn{K} is usually compared to the 
  true value of \eqn{K} for a completely random (Poisson) point process,
  which is \eqn{K(r) = \pi r^2}{K(r) = pi * r^2}.
  Deviations between the empirical and theoretical \eqn{K} curves
  may suggest spatial clustering or spatial regularity.
 
  This routine \code{Kest} estimates the \eqn{K} function
  of a stationary point process, given observation of the process
  inside a known, bounded window. 
  The argument \code{X} is interpreted as a point pattern object 
  (of class \code{"ppp"}, see \code{\link{ppp.object}}) and can
  be supplied in any of the formats recognised by
  \code{\link{as.ppp}()}.

  The estimation of \eqn{K} is hampered by edge effects arising from 
  the unobservability of points of the random pattern outside the window. 
  An edge correction is needed to reduce bias (Baddeley, 1998; Ripley, 1988). 
  The correction implemented here is the border method or
  ``reduced sample'' estimator (Ripley, 1988). Although this is less
  efficient than some alternative corrections, it has the advantage that it can
  be computed for a window of arbitrary shape.

  Note that the estimator assumes the process is stationary (spatially
  homogeneous). For inhomogeneous point patterns, see
  \code{\link{Kinhom}}.

  The estimator \code{Kest} ignores marks.
  Its counterparts for multitype point patterns
  are \code{\link{Kcross}}, \code{\link{Kdot}},
  and for general marked point patterns
  see \code{\link{Kmulti}}. 

  Some writers, particularly Stoyan (1994, 1995) advocate the use of
  the ``pair correlation function''
  \deqn{
    g(r) = \frac{K'(r)}{2\pi r}
  }{
    g(r) = K'(r)/ ( 2 * pi * r) 
  }
  where \eqn{K'(r)} is the derivative of \eqn{K(r)}.
  See \code{\link{pcf}} on how to estimate this function.

\section{Warnings}{
  The estimator of \eqn{K(r)} is approximately unbiased for each fixed \eqn{r}.
  Bias increases with \eqn{r} and depends on the window geometry.
  For a rectangular window it is prudent to restrict the \eqn{r} values to
  a maximum of \eqn{1/4} of the smaller side length of the rectangle.
  Bias may become appreciable for point patterns consisting of 
  fewer than 15 points.
 
  While \eqn{K(r)} is always a non-decreasing function, the estimator 
  of \eqn{K} is not guaranteed to be non-decreasing. This is rarely 
  a problem in practice.
