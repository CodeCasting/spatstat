\title{Convert Point Pattern to Pixel Image}
\description{
  Converts a point pattern to a pixel image. The value in each pixel
  is the number of points falling in that pixel, and is typically
  either 0 or 1.
}
\usage{
pixellate(x, \dots, weights = NULL, padzero=FALSE)

\method{as.im}{ppp}(X, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x,X}{Point pattern (object of class \code{"ppp"}).}
  \item{\dots}{Arguments passed to \code{\link{as.mask}} to determine
    the pixel resolution}
  \item{weights}{Optional vector of weights associated with the points.}
  \item{padzero}{Logical flag indicating whether to set pixel values
    to zero outside the window. 
  }

\details{
  These functions convert a spatial point pattern \code{x} into a pixel
  image, by counting the number of points (or the total weight of
  points) falling in each pixel.

  The function \code{as.im.ppp} is a method for the generic
  function \code{\link{as.im}} for the class of point patterns. It is
  equivalent to calling \code{pixellate} with its default
  values. The function \code{pixellate} has additional arguments for
  greater flexibility.

  First, the window containing \code{x} is converted to a
  binary pixel mask using \code{\link{as.mask}}.

  If \code{weights} is \code{NULL}, then for each pixel
  in the mask, the algorithm counts how many points in \code{x} fall
  in the pixel. This count is usually either 0 (for a pixel with no data
  points in it) or 1 (for a pixel containing one data point) but may be
  greater than 1. The result is an image with these counts as its pixel values.

  If \code{weights} is given, it should be a numeric vector of the same
  length as the number of points in \code{x}. For each pixel, the
  algorithm finds the total weight associated with points in \code{x} that fall
  in the given pixel. The result is an image with these total weights
  as its pixel values.

  By default (if \code{zeropad=FALSE}) the resulting pixel image has the same
  spatial domain as the window of the point pattern \code{x}. If
  \code{zeropad=TRUE} then the resulting pixel image has a rectangular
  domain; pixels outside the original window are assigned the value zero.
