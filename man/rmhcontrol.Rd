\value{

}
\details{
  The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, implemented as \code{\link{rmh}},
  generates simulated realisations of point process models.
  This function \code{rmhcontrol}
  sets up a list of parameters which control the 
  iterative behaviour
  and termination of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, for use in a
  subsequent call to \code{\link{rmh}}. It also checks that the
  parameters are valid.

  (A separate function \code{\link{rmhstart}}
  determines the initial state of the algorithm,
  and \code{\link{rmhmodel}} determines the model to be simulated.)

  The algorithm control parameters should be specified \bold{either} by the
  first argument \code{control} \bold{or} by the other arguments
  \code{p}, \code{q} etc.
  
  If \code{control} is specified, it may be a list of parameter values
  (with components named \code{p}, \code{q} etc,
  having the same interpretation as described below)
  or an object of class \code{"rmhcontrol"} obtained by a previous
  call to \code{rmhcontrol}.

  The parameters are as follows:
  
  \describe{
    \item{p}{The probability of proposing a ``shift''
      (as opposed to a birth or death) in the Metropolis-Hastings
      algorithm.

      If \eqn{p = 1} then the algorithm only alters existing points,
      so the number of points never changes, i.e. we are
      simulating conditionally upon the number of points.
      The number of points is determined by the initial state
      (specified by \code{\link{rmhstart}}).

      If \eqn{p=1} and \code{fixall=TRUE} and the model
      is a multitype point process model, then the algorithm
      only shifts the locations of existing points and does not
      alter their marks (types). 
      This is equivalent to simulating conditionally
      upon the number of points of each type.
      These numbers are again specified by the initial state.

      If \eqn{p = 1} then no expansion of the simulation window
      is allowed (see \code{expand} below).
    }
    \item{q}{The conditional probability of proposing a death
      (rather than a birth) given that a shift is not proposed.
      This is of course ignored if \code{p} is equal to 1.
    }
    \item{nrep}{The number of repetitions or iterations 
      to be made by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.  It should
      be large.
    }
    \item{expand}{
      Either a numerical expansion factor, or
      a window (object of class \code{"owin"}). Indicates that
      the process is to be simulated on a larger domain than the
      original data window \code{w}, then clipped to \code{w}
      when the algorithm has finished.
      This would often be done in order to approximate the
      simulation of a stationary process (Geyer, 1999)
      or more generally a process existing in the
      whole plane, rather than just in the window \code{w}.
	 
      If \code{expand} is a window object, it is taken as the
      larger domain in which simulation is performed.
      If \code{expand} is numeric, it is interpreted
      as the factor by which the \emph{area} of the enclosing box of the
      window \code{w} is to be expanded (i.e. width and height are
      stretched by the same factor \code{sqrt(area)}).
      The expansion is computed by the function \code{\link{expand.owin}}.
	 
      If \code{expand} equals 1 then no expansion is performed.
      Any value of \code{expand} smaller than 1 is ignored and
      treated as 1.

      Expansion is not permitted if the number of points has been
      fixed by setting \code{p = 1} or if the
      starting configuration has been specified via the
      argument \code{x.start} in \code{\link{rmhstart}}.
      In these cases \code{expand} defaults to 1.

      Otherwise, \code{expand} defaults to 2.
    }
    \item{periodic}{A logical scalar; if \code{periodic} is \code{TRUE}
      we simulate a process on the torus formed by identifying
      opposite edges of a rectangular window.  This window could
      be the ``original'' window if that window is rectangular, or
      the bounding box of that window, or an expansion of the
      bounding box (when \code{expand} is greater than 1).  In the
      latter two cases the simulated pattern is clipped to the
      original window.
    }
    \item{ptypes}{A vector of probabilities (summing to 1) to be used
      in assigning a random type to a new point.  Defaults to a vector
      each of whose entries is \eqn{1/nt} where \eqn{nt} is the number
      of types for the process.  Convergence of the simulation
      algorithm should be improved if \code{ptypes} is close to the
      relative frequencies of the types which will result from the
      simulation.
    }
    \item{fixall}{A logical scalar specifying whether to condition on
      the number of points of each type.  Meaningful only if a marked
      process is being simulated, and if \eqn{p = 1}.  A warning message
      is given if \code{fixall} is set equal to \code{TRUE} when it is
      not meaningful.
    }
    \item{nverb}{An integer specifying how often ``progress reports''
      (which consist simply of the number of repetitions completed)
      should be printed out.  If nverb is left at 0, the default,
      the simulation proceeds silently.
