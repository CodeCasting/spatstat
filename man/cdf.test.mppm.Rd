\title{Spatial Distribution Test for Multiple Point Process Model} 
\description{
  Performs a spatial distribution test
  of a Poisson point process model fitted to multiple spatial point
  patterns.  The test compares the observed
  and predicted distributions of the values of a spatial covariate,
  using either the Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
  \ifelse{latex}{\out{Cram\'er}}{Cramer}-von Mises 
  or Anderson-Darling test of goodness-of-fit.
}
\usage{
\method{cdf.test}{mppm}(model, covariate, test=c("ks", "cvm", "ad"), ...,
            verbose=TRUE, interpolate=FALSE, fast=TRUE, jitter=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{model}{
    An object of class \code{"mppm"} representing a point process model
    fitted to multiple spatial point patterns.
  }
  \item{covariate}{
    The spatial covariate on which the test will be based.
    A function, a pixel image, a list of functions, a list of pixel
    images, a hyperframe, or a character string containing the name
    of one of the covariates in \code{model}.
  }
  \item{test}{
    Character string identifying the test to be performed:
    \code{"ks"} for Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
    \code{"cvm"} for \ifelse{latex}{\out{Cram\'er}}{Cramer}-von Mises test
    or \code{"ad"} for Anderson-Darling test.
  }
  \item{\dots}{
    Arguments passed to \code{\link{cdf.test}}
    to control the test.
  }
  \item{verbose}{Logical flag indicating whether to print
    progress reports.
  }
  \item{interpolate}{
    Logical flag indicating whether to interpolate between
    pixel values when code{covariate} is a pixel image.
    See \emph{Details}.
  }
  \item{fast}{
    Logical flag. If \code{TRUE}, values of the covariate
    are only sampled at the original quadrature points used to
    fit the model. If \code{FALSE}, values of the covariate
    are sampled at all pixels, which can be slower by three orders of
    magnitude.
  }
  \item{jitter}{
    Logical flag. If \code{TRUE}, observed values of the covariate
    are perturbed by adding small random values, to avoid
    tied observations.
  }

\details{
  This function is a method for the generic function
  \code{\link{cdf.test}} for the class \code{mppm}.

  This function performs a goodness-of-fit test of
  a point process model that has been fitted to multiple point patterns.
  The observed distribution
  of the values of a spatial covariate at the data points,
  and the predicted distribution of the same values under the model,
  are compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
  
  The argument \code{model} should be a fitted point process model
  fitted to multiple point patterns
  (object of class \code{"mppm"}). It should be a Poisson point process.
  
  The argument \code{covariate} contains the values of a spatial
  function. It can be
  \itemize{
    \item a \code{function(x,y)}
    \item a pixel image (object of class \code{"im"}
    \item a list of \code{function(x,y)}, one for each point pattern
    \item a list of pixel images, one for each point pattern
    \item a hyperframe (see \code{\link{hyperframe}})
    of which the first
    column will be taken as containing the covariate
    \item a character string giving the name of one of the covariates
    in \code{model}.
  }
  If \code{covariate} is an image, it should have numeric values,
  and its domain should cover the observation window of the
  \code{model}. If \code{covariate} is a function, it should expect
  two arguments \code{x} and \code{y} which are vectors of coordinates,
  and it should return a numeric vector of the same length
  as \code{x} and \code{y}.  

  First the original data point pattern is extracted from \code{model}.
  The values of the \code{covariate} at these data points are
  collected. 

  The predicted distribution of the values of the \code{covariate}
  under the fitted \code{model} is computed as follows.
  The values of the \code{covariate} at all locations in the
  observation window are evaluated,
  weighted according to the point process intensity of the fitted model,
  and compiled into a cumulative distribution function \eqn{F} using
  \code{\link{ewcdf}}.

  The probability integral transformation is then applied:
  the values of the \code{covariate} at the original data points
  are transformed by the predicted cumulative distribution function
  \eqn{F} into numbers between 0 and 1. If the model is correct,
  these numbers are i.i.d. uniform random numbers. 
  A goodness-of-fit test of the uniform distribution is applied
  to these numbers using \code{\link[stats]{ks.test}},
  \code{\link[goftest]{cvm.test}} or \code{\link[goftest]{ad.test}}.

  This test was apparently first described (in the context of
  spatial data, and for Kolmogorov-Smirnov) by Berman (1986).
  See also Baddeley et al (2005).

  The argument \code{interpolate} determines 
  how pixel values will be handled when code{covariate} is a pixel image.
  The value of the covariate at a data point is obtained
  by looking up the value of the nearest pixel if
  \code{interpolate=FALSE}, or by linearly interpolating
  between the values of the four nearest pixels 
  if \code{interpolate=TRUE}. Linear interpolation is slower,
  but is sometimes necessary to avoid tied values of the covariate
  arising when the pixel grid is coarse.
