\title{Extract or Replace Subset of Tessellation}
\description{
  Extract, change or delete a subset of the tiles of a tessellation,
  to make a new tessellation.
}
\usage{
  \method{[}{tess}(x, ...)
  \method{[}{tess}(x, ...) <- value
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{A tessellation (object of class \code{"tess"}).}
  \item{\dots}{
     One argument that specifies the subset to be extracted or changed.
     Any valid format for the subset index in a list.
  }
  \item{value}{
     Replacement value for the selected tiles of the tessellation.
     A list of windows (objects of class \code{"owin"}) or \code{NULL}. 
  }
}
\details{
  A tessellation (object of class \code{"tess"}, see \code{\link{tess}})
  is effectively a list of tiles (spatial regions) that cover a spatial region.
  The subset operator \code{[.tess} extracts some
  of these tiles and forms a new tessellation, which of course covers a
  smaller region than the original. 
  
  The replacement operator changes the selected tiles. The replacement
  \code{value} may be either \code{NULL} (which causes the selected tiles
  to be removed from \code{x}) or a list of the same length as
  the selected subset. The entries of \code{value} may be windows
  (objects of class \code{"owin"}) or \code{NULL} to indicate that the
  corresponding tile should be deleted.

  Generally it does not make sense to replace a tile in a tessellation
  with a completely different tile, because the tiles are expected to
  fit together. However this facility is sometimes useful for making
  small adjustments to polygonal tiles.
