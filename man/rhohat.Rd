\details{
  If \code{object} is a point pattern, this command assumes that
  \code{object} is a realisation of a Poisson point process with
  intensity function \eqn{\lambda(u)}{lambda(u)} of the form
  \deqn{\lambda(u) = \rho(Z(u))}{lambda(u) = rho(Z(u))} where
  \eqn{Z} is the spatial covariate function given by \code{covariate},
  and \eqn{\rho(z)}{rho(z)} is a function to be estimated. 
  This command computes estimators of \eqn{\rho(z)}{rho(z)}
  proposed by Baddeley and Turner (2005)
  and Baddeley et al (2012).

  The covariate \eqn{Z} must have continuous values.

  If \code{object} is a fitted point process model, suppose \code{X} is
  the original data point pattern to which the model was fitted. Then
  this command assumes \code{X} is a realisation of a Poisson point
  process with intensity function of the form
  \deqn{
    \lambda(u) = \rho(Z(u)) \kappa(u)
  }{
    lambda(u) = rho(Z(u)) * kappa(u)
  }
  where \eqn{\kappa(u)}{kappa(u)} is the intensity of the fitted model
  \code{object}. A smoothing estimator of \eqn{\rho(z)}{rho(z)} is computed.

  The estimation procedure is determined by the character strings
  \code{method} and \code{smoother}.
  The estimation procedure involves computing several density estimates
  and combining them. 
  The algorithm used to compute density estimates is 
  determined by \code{smoother}:
  \itemize{
    \item If \code{smoother="kernel"},
    each the smoothing procedure is based on
    fixed-bandwidth kernel density estimation,
    performed by \code{\link{density.default}}.
    \item If \code{smoother="local"}, the smoothing procedure
    is based on local likelihood density estimation, performed by
    \code{\link[locfit]{locfit}}.
  }
  The \code{method} determines how the density estimates will be
  combined to obtain an estimate of \eqn{\rho(z)}{rho(z)}:
  \itemize{
    \item
    If \code{method="ratio"}, then \eqn{\rho(z)}{rho(z)} is
    estimated by the ratio of two density estimates.
    The numerator is a (rescaled) density estimate obtained by
    smoothing the values \eqn{Z(y_i)}{Z(y[i])} of the covariate
    \eqn{Z} observed at the data points \eqn{y_i}{y[i]}. The denominator
    is a density estimate of the reference distribution of \eqn{Z}.
    \item
    If \code{method="reweight"}, then \eqn{\rho(z)}{rho(z)} is
    estimated by applying density estimation to the 
    values \eqn{Z(y_i)}{Z(y[i])} of the covariate
    \eqn{Z} observed at the data points \eqn{y_i}{y[i]},
    with weights inversely proportional to the reference density of
    \eqn{Z}.
    \item 
    If \code{method="transform"},
    the smoothing method is variable-bandwidth kernel
    smoothing, implemented by applying the Probability Integral Transform
    to the covariate values, yielding values in the range 0 to 1,
    then applying edge-corrected density estimation on the interval
    \eqn{[0,1]}, and back-transforming.
  }

  The covariate will be evaluated on a fine grid of locations,
  with spatial resolution controlled by the arguments
  \code{dimyx,eps,nd}. 
  In two dimensions (i.e.
  if \code{object} is of class \code{"ppp"}, \code{"ppm"} or
  \code{"quad"}) the arguments \code{dimyx, eps} are
  passed to \code{\link{as.mask}} to control the pixel
  resolution. On a linear network (i.e. if \code{object} is of class
  \code{"lpp"} or \code{"lppm"}) the argument \code{nd} specifies the
  total number of test locations on the linear
  network, and \code{eps} specifies the linear separation between test
  locations. 
}
\value{
  A function value table (object of class \code{"fv"})
  containing the estimated values of \eqn{\rho}{rho} for a sequence
  of values of \eqn{Z}.
  Also belongs to the class \code{"rhohat"}
  which has special methods for \code{print}, \code{plot}
  and \code{predict}.
}
\section{Categorical and discrete covariates}{
  This technique assumes that the covariate has continuous values.
  It is not applicable to covariates with categorical (factor) values
  or discrete values such as small integers.
  For a categorical covariate, use
  \code{\link{quadratcount}(X, tess=covariate)}
