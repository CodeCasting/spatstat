\title{
  California Redwoods Point Pattern (Ripley's Subset)
}
\description{
  Locations of 62 seedlings and saplings 
  of California redwood trees.
 
  The data represent the locations of 62 seedlings and saplings 
  of California redwood trees in a square sampling region.  
  They originate from Strauss (1975);
  the present data are a subset extracted by Ripley (1977) 
  in a subregion that has been rescaled to a unit square.
 
  There are many further analyses of this dataset. It is often used as a 
  canonical example of a clustered point pattern
  (see e.g. Diggle, 1983).

  The original, full redwood dataset is supplied in the \code{spatstat}
  library as \code{redwoodfull}.
} 
\format{
  An object of class \code{"ppp"}
  representing the point pattern of tree locations.
  The window has been rescaled to the unit square.

  See \code{\link{ppp.object}} for details of the format of a
  point pattern object.
