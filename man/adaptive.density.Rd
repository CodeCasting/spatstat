\arguments{
  \item{X}{Point pattern dataset (object of class \code{"ppp"}).}

    removed from the data and used to determine a tessellation for the
    intensity estimate.

\details{
  This function is an alternative to \code{\link{density.ppp}}. It
  computes an estimate of the intensity function of a point pattern
  dataset. The result is a pixel image giving the estimated intensity,

  If \code{f=1}, the Voronoi estimate (Barr and Schoenberg, 2010)
  is computed: the point pattern \code{X} is used to construct
  a Voronoi/Dirichlet tessellation (see \code{\link{dirichlet}});
  the areas of the Dirichlet tiles are computed; the estimated intensity
  in each tile is the reciprocal of the tile area.

  If \code{f=0}, the intensity estimate at every location is
  equal to the average intensity (number of points divided by window area).
  
  If \code{f} is strictly between 0 and 1, 
  the dataset \code{X} is randomly split into two patterns \code{A} and
  \code{B} containing a fraction \code{f} and \code{1-f}, respectively,
  of the original data. The subpattern \code{A} is used to construct a
  Dirichlet tessellation, while the subpattern
  \code{B} is retained for counting. For each tile of the Dirichlet
  tessellation, we count the number of points of \code{B} falling in the
  tile, and divide by the area of the same tile, to obtain an estimate
  of the intensity of the pattern \code{B} in the tile.
  This estimate is divided by \code{1-f} to obtain an estimate
  of the intensity of \code{X} in the tile. The result is a pixel image
  of intensity estimates which are constant on each tile of the tessellation.

  If \code{nrep} is greater than 1, this randomised procedure is
  repeated \code{nrep} times, and the results are averaged.

  This technique has been used by Ogata et al. (2003), Ogata (2004)
  and Baddeley (2007).
