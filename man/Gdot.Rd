\details{
  This function \code{Gdot} and its companions
  \code{\link{Gcross}} and \code{\link{Gmulti}}
  are generalisations of the function \code{\link{Gest}}
  to multitype point patterns.

  A multitype point pattern is a spatial pattern of
  points classified into a finite number of possible
  ``colours'' or ``types''. In the \code{spatstat} package,
  a multitype pattern is represented as a single 
  point pattern object in which the points carry marks,
  and the mark value attached to each point
  determines the type of that point.
  
  The argument \code{X} must be a point pattern (object of class
  \code{"ppp"}) or any data that are acceptable to \code{\link{as.ppp}}.
  It must be a marked point pattern, and the mark vector
  \code{X$marks} must be a factor.
  The argument will be interpreted as a
  level of the factor \code{X$marks}. (Warning: this means that
  an integer value \code{i=3} will be interpreted as the 3rd smallest level,
  not the number 3). 
  
  The ``dot-type'' (type \eqn{i} to any type)
  nearest neighbour distance distribution function 
  of a multitype point process 
  is the cumulative distribution function \eqn{G_{i\bullet}(r)}{Gi.(r)}
  of the distance from a typical random point of the process with type \eqn{i}
  the nearest other point of the process, regardless of type. 

  An estimate of \eqn{G_{i\bullet}(r)}{Gi.(r)}
  is a useful summary statistic in exploratory data analysis
  of a multitype point pattern.
  If the type \eqn{i} points
  were independent of all other points,
  then \eqn{G_{i\bullet}(r)}{Gi.(r)} would equal \eqn{G_{ii}(r)}{Gii(r)},
  the nearest neighbour distance distribution function of the type
  \eqn{i} points alone.
  For a multitype Poisson point process with total intensity
  \eqn{\lambda}{lambda}, we have
  \deqn{G_{i\bullet}(r) = 1 - e^{ - \lambda \pi r^2} }{%
    Gi.(r) = 1 - exp( - lambda * pi * r^2)}
  Deviations between the empirical and theoretical
  \eqn{G_{i\bullet}}{Gi.} curves
  may suggest dependence of the type \eqn{i} points on the other points.

  This algorithm estimates the distribution function
  \eqn{G_{i\bullet}(r)}{Gi.(r)} 
  from the point pattern \code{X}. It assumes that \code{X} can be treated
  as a realisation of a stationary (spatially homogeneous) 
  random spatial point process in the plane, observed through
  a bounded window.
  The window (which is specified in \code{X} as \code{X$window})
  may have arbitrary shape.
  Biases due to edge effects are
  treated in the same manner as in \code{\link{Gest}}.

  The argument \code{r} is the vector of values for the
  distance \eqn{r} at which \eqn{G_{i\bullet}(r)}{Gi.(r)} should be evaluated. 
  It is also used to determine the breakpoints
  (in the sense of \code{\link{hist}})
  for the computation of histograms of distances. The reduced-sample and
  Kaplan-Meier estimators are computed from histogram counts. 
  In the case of the Kaplan-Meier estimator this introduces a discretisation
  error which is controlled by the fineness of the breakpoints.

  First-time users would be strongly advised not to specify \code{r}.
  However, if it is specified, \code{r} must satisfy \code{r[1] = 0}, 
  and \code{max(r)} must be larger than the radius of the largest disc 
  contained in the window. Furthermore, the successive entries of \code{r}
  must be finely spaced.

  The algorithm also returns an estimate of the hazard rate function, 
  \eqn{\lambda(r)}{lambda(r)}, of \eqn{G_{i\bullet}(r)}{Gi.(r)}. 
  This estimate should be used with caution as
  \eqn{G_{i\bullet}(r)}{Gi.(r)}
  is not necessarily differentiable.

  The naive empirical distribution of distances from each point of
  the pattern \code{X} to the nearest other point of the pattern, 
  is a biased estimate of \eqn{G_{i\bullet}}{Gi.}.
  However this is also returned by the algorithm, as it is sometimes 
  useful in other contexts. Care should be taken not to use the uncorrected
  empirical \eqn{G_{i\bullet}}{Gi.} as if it were an unbiased estimator of
  \eqn{G_{i\bullet}}{Gi.}.

\section{Warnings}{
  The argument \code{i} is interpreted as a
  level of the factor \code{X$marks}. Beware of the usual
  trap with factors: numerical values are not
  interpreted in the same way as character values. See the first example.

  The function \eqn{G_{i\bullet}}{Gi.} does not necessarily have a density. 

  The reduced sample estimator of \eqn{G_{i\bullet}}{Gi.}
  is pointwise approximately 
  unbiased, but need not be a valid distribution function; it may 
  not be a nondecreasing function of \eqn{r}. Its range is always 
  within \eqn{[0,1]}.

  The spatial Kaplan-Meier estimator of \eqn{G_{i\bullet}}{Gi.}
  is always nondecreasing
  but its maximum value may be less than \eqn{1}.
