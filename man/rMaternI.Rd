\title{Simulate Matern Model I}
\description{
  Generate a random point pattern, a simulated realisation of the
  Mat\'ern Model I inhibition process model.
}
\usage{
 rMaternI(kappa, r, win = owin(c(0,1),c(0,1)))
}
\arguments{
  \item{kappa}{
    Intensity of the Poisson process of proposal points.
    A single positive number.
  }
  \item{r}{
    Inhibition distance.
  }
  \item{win}{
    Window in which to simulate the pattern.
    An object of class \code{"owin"}
    or something acceptable to \code{\link{as.owin}}.
  }
}
\value{
  The simulated point pattern (an object of class \code{"ppp"}).
}
\details{
  This algorithm generates a realisation of Mat\'ern's Model I
  inhibition process 
  inside the window \code{win}.

  The process is constructed by first
  generating a uniform Poisson point process of ``proposal'' points 
  with intensity \code{kappa} inside the window.
  A proposal point is deleted if it lies within \code{r} units' distance
  of another proposal point. Otherwise it is retained.
  The retained points constitute Mat\'ern's Model I.
