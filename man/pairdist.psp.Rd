\title{Pairwise distances between line segments}
\description{
  Computes the matrix of distances between all pairs of line segments
  in a line segment pattern.
}
\usage{
  \method{pairdist}{psp}(X, \dots, method="Fortran")
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
    A line segment pattern (object of class \code{"psp"}).
  }
  \item{\dots}{
    Ignored.
  }
  \item{method}{
    String specifying which method of calculation to use.
    Values are \code{"Fortran"} and \code{"interpreted"}.
    Usually not specified.
  }
}
\value{
  A square matrix whose \code{[i,j]} entry is the distance
  between the line segments numbered \code{i} and \code{j}.
}
\details{
  This function computes the distance between each pair of
  line segments in \code{X}, and returns the matrix of distances.
  
  This is a method for the generic function \code{\link{pairdist}}
  for the class \code{"psp"}.

  Distances are calculated using the Hausdorff metric. The Hausdorff
  distance between two line segments is the maximum distance
  from any point on one of the segments to the nearest point on
  the other segment.   
  
  The argument \code{method} is not normally used. It is
  retained only for checking the validity of the software.
  If \code{method = "interpreted"} then the distances are
  computed using interpreted R code only. If \code{method="Fortran"}
  (the default) then Fortran code is used. The Fortran code is somewhat faster.
