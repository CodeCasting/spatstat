	CHANGES IN spatstat VERSION 1.17-6

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    o   We thank Simon Byers and Adrian Raftery for generous contributions.

OVERVIEW

    o 	Nearest neighbour clutter removal algorithm

    o   New documentation for the 'fv' class.
	
    o	Minor improvements and bug fixes.

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o	nnclean: Nearest neighbour clutter removal for recognising features 
	in spatial point patterns. Technique of Byers and Raftery (1998) 
	[From original code by Simon Byers and Adrian Raftery,
	adapted for spatstat.]

    o	marks.ppx, marks<-.ppx: Methods for extracting and changing marks
	in a multidimensional point pattern

    o   latest.news: print news about the current version of the package

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o   news: spatstat now has a NEWS file which can be printed by
	typing news(package="spatstat").

    o	areaGain, areaLoss: New algorithms in case exact=TRUE.
	Syntax slightly modified.

    o	with.hyperframe: 
		- The result now inherits 'names' from the row names
		of the hyperframe. 

		- New argument 'enclos' controls the environment
		in which the expression is evaluated.

		- The algorithm is now smarter at simplifying the result
		when simplify=TRUE.

    o	update.ppm: Tweaked to improve the ability of ppm objects
	to be re-fitted in different contexts.


ADVANCED USERS ONLY
   
    o	Documentation for the class 'fv' of function value tables

	- fv: Creates an object of class 'fv' 

	- cbind.fv, collapse.fv: Combine objects of class 'fv'		

	- bind.fv: Add additional columns of data to an 'fv' object

		
BUG FIXES

    o	"$<-.hyperframe" destroyed the row names of the hyperframe.
	Fixed.	

    o	model.matrix.ppm had minor inconsistencies.
	Fixed.		

    o	ppm: The fitted coefficient vector had incorrect format
	in the default case of a uniform Poisson process. 
	Fixed.

    o	plot.ppx: Crashed if the argument 'main' was given.
	Fixed.
